## Why is it better than others?

1. **Dynamic Page Generation**: The page is dynamically generated using data from the `userInfo.jsx` file. This enables direct use, requiring only data fetching from the database.

2. **Optimized Data Fetching**: All necessary data is fetched in a single request, enhancing page optimization. Sorting, searching, and filtering logic is handled at the frontend, resulting in superior performance compared to making multiple requests.

3. **Debounced Search**: Searching is optimized through the implementation of debouncing, improving the user experience by reducing unnecessary API calls.

4. **Code Structure**: The code is well-structured, promoting readability and maintainability for future development and collaboration.

5. **Functional Navbar**: The navbar functionality extends to different tabs, providing a seamless navigation experience for users.

6. **Downloadable PDF Feature**: Users have the ability to download the displayed data as a PDF, offering added convenience and versatility.

7. **Deployed**: This has deployed on Vercel. [<ins>**View Here**<ins>](https://dukaan-assignment-552rxwwnw-shoaib-31.vercel.app) and go to Payouts tab.

These enhancements collectively contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly web application.
